## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to use the "background-image" CSS property to set the image as a background of a div element. Then, to send the image to the back, I added "position: absolute" to it while the parent element and element at the front have "position: relative" style.

I also learned to use the "background-size" property to adjust the size of the background image.
